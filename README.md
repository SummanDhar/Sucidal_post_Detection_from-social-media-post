## Overview 
## üí°Inspiration
Suicide might be considered as one of the most serious social health problems in modern society. Every year, almost 800,000 people commit suicide. Suicide remains the second leading cause of death among a young generation with an overall suicide rate of 10.5 per 100,000 people. Especially in this pandemic suicide rate has increased. Many factors can lead to suicide, for example, personal issues, such as hopelessness, severe anxiety, or impulsivity; social factors, like social isolation and overexposure to deaths; or negative life events, and previous suicide attempts, etc. Millions of peoples around the world fall victims to suicide every year, making suicide prevention become a critical global public health mission.

## üßêWhat it does
Early detection and treatment are regarded as the most effective ways to prevent suicidal ideation and potential suicide attempts‚Äîtwo critical risk factors resulting in successful suicides.   
In this project, we propose an API that can be used to tag any textual data with a potential suicidal thought tag or neutral tag. 
We used supervised Machine learning to train our model which can detect the Suicidal severity of the post.  
We also deployed our model on **Heroku** using **Flask** and **mlrun** alongwith **MongoDB Atlas** to demonstrate the **` applicability`** of the project.

## ‚öôÔ∏èHow we built it
We took a tweet dataset published on this  [Github repository](https://github.com/AminuIsrael/Predicting-Suicide-Ideation). We trained our model on two different models SGD classifier and the simple preceptor model. 
We used `mlrun` to automate our pipeline. We first fetch the dataset from the MongoDB Atlas database, pre-process it, and trained two models discussed earlier, and finally, the best model is used for serving.   
We also deployed it on `Heroku` to display the `applicability` of the API. Our pipeline is fully automated and robust to data accusation when someone uses our API, it stores each instance in a CSV file on the server and once it reached a limit, the pipeline automatically pushes the data to the MongoDB database and retrain the models. Also, choose the best model out of two for severing, so basically we are doing Semi-Supervise learning to make our model better.
### üìöData we used
We used data of the posts by the people posting suicidal and normal tweets. This data is kept on MongoDB Atlas. label '1' from dataset represents suicidal and label '0' as neutral. Total number of samples are 9119 and its distributed as 4000 and 5119 for suicidal and neutral ones respectively.
eg. I want to end my life _Suicidal
eg. Its a good day _Neutral

### ‚õìPipeline workflow
For the pipeline automation and tracking of logs, we used an open-sourced **`mlrun`** library which gives us the flexibility to create a Machine learning pipeline, manage the pipeline logs, and deploy it in a production environment.   
The features we leveraged from this library are automated data fetching and preparation, model training and testing, deployment of real-time production pipelines, and end-to-end monitoring using Heroku server logs.  
The image below depicts our `MLRun pipeline workflow`

</p>  -->

We successfully implemented the following process with help of **`mlrun`**.  
### ‚öôÔ∏è Fetching data.   
Data are stored in MongoDB atlas on a cloud database. When the mlrun pipeline is executed the fetch function will download the suicide dataset from the MongoDB atlas database, convert it into DataFrame and serve it for data transformation.

</p> 

### üîßTransformation of data.  
The process of pre-processing is added to tranform function of the pipeline, we took advantage of the mlrun's `PlotArtifacts` API to plot some insight of the dataset. Finally the function pre-process our dataset and serve it for model training.

</p> 

### ÔøΩ‚è±Model training and evaluation.
In this pipeline we training our data on different models
1. SGD classifier
2. Preceptor model

</p> 

The dataset is trained on both models, then after evaluation, the accuracy is compared in the pipeline. And the best model is saved and used for serving with the help of `mlrun`.  
The logs of the model training were tracked by `mlrun` for both models. Here also we took advantage of mlrun's `PlotArtifacts` API to plot the accuracies of the model. Below is an example of the log.

### üçõModel serving.  
After pre-processing and model training , best model was selected by the pipeline and used for inference. With help of `mlrun` with serve our model for testing. Example is dmonstrated below.

### üõ†Model retraining.  
This one of the main features of our pipeline. We integrated **`retraining`** of our models using two different processes-
1. Inference time data: We collected the data produce during inference time, we stored the input data and predicted labels on our server in `CSV file. Once the data reaches a limit of 1000 samples. Our pipeline pushes the dataset to `MongoBD atlas` on the cloud and begins the retraining process, discussed earlier.
2. Bulk training: We also integrated bulk training in our pipeline. When we collect datasets from other sources in bulk, we can use `/bulktraining` API. We can pass the CSV file, our pipeline will store the dataset on the cloud and begin the retraining process, discussed earlier.  

### üõ† Iguazio Data Science platform
We were fortunate to get access of Iguazio platform to demostrate our project. We deployed and ran our pipeline on Iguazio Data science platform. Below are some of the screenshot which demontrate artifacts, result and logs produce during training.

## ‚ùìWhat's next for Suicide predictions 
We plan to incorporate a few more classification classes so as to get more information out of the text, which will help in better prediction of the suicidal severity. We also planned to create a Qn/A chatbot, which will be helpful for people dealing with suicidal thoughts.    
This project is not limited to only Suicide post prediction, in this new age social media world, textual data is being generated every second. These data can be leveraged in many ways, like deep sentiment analysis, health care-related problems can be solved, hate and toxicity of the post can be detected to stop bullying, etc.
