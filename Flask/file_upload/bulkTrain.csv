1,i gonna try and end it again its a long story i will start from the beginningwhen we started dating it happened really fast the second date she had me stay over at her place and we were making out and naked things were getting hot i went to make a move i was hard she said no its too soon and we dont have a label on the relation ship i didnt mind being blue balled but she said no few dates later we put a label a couple weeks later she goes to visit family for a month before she goes we go to have sex thats when it didnt work my dick didnt get hard i was devistated she did nothing to try and help arouse me basicly said what ever later then night i went to try and do stuff with her again she said no pushing me away i felt extremely rejected i felt sooo defective like i was broken anyway she gets back from her trip and doesnt want to do anything with me cause shes on her period augest was a bad month for me a lot of stuff was causing me serious stress i suffer from depression which only made things worse one night she rejected my efforts yet again i felt the world falling beneath me it wasnt just her rejection it was my families financial problems my 2 best friends moving away her constant rejection and me feeling like the pathetic 22 year old virgin that i am i attempted suicide she didnt know but on her birthday she found out i was with her and she asked me about it i denied it then she just walked up and left a day later she broke up with me saying an old flame msged her and she wants to try with him a week later we go to talk and she wants to be more then friend but not a couple i heart broken say yes worst yes of my life she starts telling me about guys shes seeing and i cant bring my self to say stop shes only been with 2 other guys this one guy devon she said she was in love with him still ps he is the only one thats fucked her good he only uses her for sex and she tells me about how she doesnt want to be one of the other girls that says they love him because that happens to devon a lot he need loves them back but hey shes in love with him i find out she fucked him during the time we were dating before we had a label and shortly after we broke upi amfuming now she keeps telling me about how much she likes me and gets cuddle with me and uses me as emotional support so we talk and agree to have sec again i want to do it to try and redeem my self worse night of my lifei ampretty much suicidal right now btw remember how she didnt want to have sex in the beginning because we didnt have a label on the relationship god i am a fucking moroni am not hung up on her spacificly but rather my pathetic love life
1,just an empty rant its been five months and on the outside i look like i finally have it togetheri am not homeless anymore i volunteer i go to disabled people groups for people like me with chronic pain and mobility issuesi amgetting a therapy animal i work on two different therapy tactics to gain control over my various disorders yet i truly died early january i broke over and over i went into psychotic episodes i lost reality i lost my home after a pretty bad chain reaction break up so cheating finding out i was pregnant a miscarriage having to leave the property we hadhim taking all the furniturea personi am still in love with and a healthy body combined with a lot of mind games lies and constant pressure from other people that just kept pushing me over the edgei amjust a difficult worthless and unlovable person i developed pneumonia twice various viral infections a womb thats damaged and my chronic pain got worse i had many trips to the hospital during my five months homelessness i got briefly stalked and attacked by a man in a night shelter i was staying at i began ignoring my pain level and forcing myself out everyday i couldnt sleep i couldnt eat i refused my medications i was constantly anxious and having panic attacks daily i got addicted to sleeping pills for a while if anything just not to remember and just not have to face reality i got my home two months ago i saved every penny i had during my homeless time and bought new furniture decorated a disability bed etc and have disability functions installed within so i dont get so tired yet for the life of me i still wake up everyday empty cold wishing i was dead wishing i did die i stopped speaking my friends and siblings only wanted a house to use money to borrow a hotel with free wifi forever showing up uninvited triggering ptsd and anxiety with constant knocking multiple times a day despite my protests of not wanting anyone near me or telling themi amout or not answering the door they didnt care no one cared or checked in if i went off the radar for weeks unless i could do them favours i run but nothing stops it nothing eases the memories or the pain or the ache you feel when someone you loved isnt there anymore how you miss them so badly your teeth ache your chest hurts your head replays all the best and the worst parts in your head knowing youre not good enough for the world for friendships for life for family that only check in to borrow money knowing it was all your fault youre the toxic ugly evil person and no amount of remorse or guilt you feel can fix it i forced myself to change and be healthy but i amjust an empty shell a damaged doll with an expiry date i tried to do good with false hope itd eventually get better but nothing changes how it feels nothing is going to make people care or my dad to love me or for people to come back to notice and miss me if i disappearim already a ghost i just wish i had the courage to finally end it
1,i am quitting once i fail to meet the training standards this is enough as i move closer to finishing my requirements for work i am having second thoughts i was just forced by my parents to work threatened and made sure that i do it by having me watched they told everyone that finally i have a job because it was with my own decision but never told that to make me move they had me threatened i am already willing to go back to school but was given excuses like there is no more money imagine the shock i got when i found out they bought gold and watches and trying to fix what they had ruined i have been fooled 
1,am so done please help me i am 20 i cant tell much about my personal life however all i would say is that i have this particular issue that my family and some people mock me for they dont understand it it has been causing me a lot of depression for long i am now also in a relationship but my family wouldnt approve of it it may get to the point that they would literally create lots of arguments for me my sibling also had certain issue and moved far away to europe to get away from my family because they were causing her hell she tried explaining them but they wouldnt listen and would just laugh at her to the point she decided to sort of screw them and make her own choices since i am young i dont have to take any step for my relationship just yet but later on i may need to and just the thought about that stresses me my family thinks they are doing right in their own way and are trying to protect us while i was away to canada for university i got disconnected from them to the point that i was willing to stand up for myself for what i believe in and also i sort of started hating them for dividing the family so much however whenever i go back home to france my family show me so much love that i end up feeling guilty for everything i feel think believe etc for summer vacation i stayed with my family for 3 months back home and i got so connected that i feel soo depressed they seriously do a lot for me its just that they think what they are doing is right and no amount of argument or discussion is going to change their mind believe me i tried i was pretty much a family oriented person back when i was in high school my siblings were my bestfriends as i was bullied a lot in high school i have also been sexually assaulted i loved hanging with my family more than anyone else now its so hard my depression has increased to the point that i ended up getting bad grades have headaches all the time lost interest in my partner feel tired all the time just thinking about future makes me cry and the only way i feel a little relaxed is when i think ah perhaps i will die soon also i am having lots of problems with my university professers are shit degree is risky cos people who graduated from here some of them claimed that many faced problems cos of their degree as the university isnt accredited by the canadian law rather the country the university is originally from i talked to my family about it but they dont think anything would happen and just keep telling me dont listen to others i am so fed up of explaining them literally anything that i am just done i dont wanna do it now i am so stressed about literally everything career family future etc i dont know what the hell to do i just wanna kill myself the only thing holding me back from committing suicide is the thought of hell existing and me not knowing whether god is pleased with me or not

1,this weight is crushing mei amsitting here at my job bored out of my mind its a decent job although the hours 1a930a are a problem ive been getting terrible sleep recently and thats probably the cause of at least some of my problems typically i go home and sleep until the kids get home then wake up until they go to bed my wife doesnt go to bed until ive left for work so i sleep alone sunthurs ive got three kids and i feel like a terrible father my 7 year old daughter wanted me to play barbies with her last night and i didnt i just didnt want to it almost made her cry and all i felt was exasperation my wife and i were having problems last year she started meds to help her anxiety that killed her sex drive but after months of trying to keep our sex life alive i stopped it was just too exhausting she stopped taking her meds without telling me and her sex drive came back but id already checked out so she had at least three online affairs i eventually found out and doing the math she was having affairs for 1012 months of our 14 year marriage i was a complete wreck for almost a month i took her phone randomly to check up on her i scoured our past phone bills for evidence of her texting or calling and noted all the contacts i did see i eventually decided it hurt too much to distrust her and realized i was actually happier in the brief time id given up on our relationship and focused on my own happiness before i found out about her affairs i realized i wasnt and couldnt give her the validation she needed we talked and decided for her to post in one or more of the gonewild subs i had full access to her account and could see all of her communication i even tested her by making up a username and pming to see what she did despite having a name that suggested someone local that she could probably meet up with she panicked at the thought someone out there might find out who she was and never even pmed back at first i was doing all of the posting as she said she wanted me involved she wanted it to be for us but she did message some guys back and had conversations one in particular was getting a little too personal for my comfort so i asked her to stop amazingly she did then she started posting on her own sometimes she posted references to her husband or being married but not always yesterday she had me take a pic of her flashing while making dinner and in response to a comment asking what wasd for dinner she mentioned that she was for dessert hubbys favorite i woke up alone in bed at 1145 and just laid there until 1210 i got out of bed and went upstairs to find her reading on the couch we had a cigarette together on the porch and then i went to work i was making coffee when i saw another post from her new pictures mentioning being ready for bed and included some of her touching herself i over reacted and we had a text argument until almost three am about how it looked like she was fishing for guys again i deleted the account id been using to post pictures of myself and commenting on her posts as her husband i basically told her i was going back to sticking my head in the sand and letting her do what she wants to be happy but i dont want toi am tired of fightingi am tired of being so nauseated at the thought of my wife with someone else that i cant eati am tired of being a terrible husbandi am tired of being a terrible father id planned to commit suicide nearly 3 years ago on my birthday i went to work and had my gun with me i planned to get that last bit of overtime and then drive into the mountains and shoot myself in the brain like my grandfather did on my first break i checked my voicemail and had one from my girls wishing me a happy birthday i couldnt do it i snuck the gun back into the house that night and havent really thought about it since my birthday is coming up 18 days i will be 38 years old with depression thats been untreated for over 20 yearsi amjust so tired at this point my wife can take a flying fuck through a rolling donut but i cant do that to my kids my oldest is 14 and already showing signs of depression i have to keep fighting to prove to her that its a winnable fight but i feari amlosing more and more each day tldr a bunch of rambling poor me bullshit

1,can someone just convince me not to commit suicide i tried to yesterday chickened out almost made it all the way before i stopped but next time i know itll be differenti amhorribly depressed i have been for many years since july its gotten out of control to the point where i plan out my suicide daily write my suicide notes daily as well everyone has left me all my friends including my best friend of five years without any warning just stopped talking to me my boyfriend left me said it was all my fault and that he didnt care about me and that i was nothing to him i started college now and its just gotten worsei am in debt i can make no friends there and these days i dont even go to class then i hear the disappointment from everyone around me i sit in bed all day i do nothing ive lost 30lbs give or take i dont sleep currently havent slept in over 24 hours and i dont even take joy in the things i once loved on monday i was at therapy when my therapist laughed at me while i was telling my feelings the same day someone was threatening me with blackmail and said hell ruin my life if i dont let him rape me and when i tried to reach out to multiple people they all gave some response on the lines of i dont care i guess this is my last attempt my last cry for help
1,cant believe i am here again quick recap stopped self harming in december had a failed suicide attempt in january and in march started separation process with my now ex husband it was tough going but my suicidal urges went down and i thought gone for goodbut nope life keeps kicking me down i got to the point last night that i had to call my therapist i just looked at the overwhelming mess in my house and life and wanted to kill myself now i just want to take a bunch of pills and sleep for a week
1,i feel likei am in the sidelines of life and want to die on my own terms ive been thinking for a while watching my life slowly become worse at time goes on experiences after experiences lost activities that seem normal to some just arent me i feel like i am living on the side lines of life and i can see the rest of my life tooi am going to continue paying off debt and working telli am in my 60s if i can retire i cant even enjoy my retirement because racking health problems will prevent me from doing that that is if i make it to 60 i have a heart condition that has a high chance of preventing me from living past 45 i will indulge in meaningless shit trying to feel human but cant i will always be a husk i dont want to feel happiness i dont want to do anything besides die and end this stupid act once and for all i can feel my mental capacity and motivation dwindling i wish i could be like the lot of you i wish i could be normal i wish reality felt real so one day maybe a year from now maybe sooner i plan to shoot myself and that will be that
1,ive committed to planning my suicide does anyone want to keep me companythis will take a while to plan and execute
1,slowly dying i have been depressed for sometime now i used to go to a counselor every other week but then summer hit and i had an internship that made it really hard to make appointments but a lot has happened since i have seen him and i feel like i am back to the start were i just want to die the most ironic thing is that i always wanted to die in an accident or get a serious i willness well about two months ago i started having liver problems and i found out a few weeks ago that i have an autoimmune disease that will eventually kill me they say it will take probably 40 years for it to actually kill me since it is not a super serious disease the funny thing is that i got what i wanted but i do not feel any better
1,amstarting to doubt that it gets betteri am22 my life has been an endless rollercoaster of miserable fucked up shit interrupted by periods of time where it looks like everything might turn out okay only for the rug to get yanked out from under me and the fuckery to begin anew i cant remember most of my childhood because i was raped my a priest when i was in fourth grade i cant really remember much of anything about my life even shit that happened fairly recently i cant maintain normal relationships first one ended in me being stalked for five years second one was just me being used thirdfourth was a fucking disaster that left me completely doubting my self worth no it hasnt come back a year and a half later and seriously contemplating death this is also when my mother lost her shit culminating in a series of 5hr long screaming sessions over nothing that left me with some serious fucking anxiety and then i got kicked out on short noticefifth relationship was going great until basically got kicked to the curb without warning two weeks before we were supposed to move in together after two months of not talking i started seeing her again as a friends with benefits type thing i kind of hate myself for it but the alternative is being more or less completely alone because its really hard for me to meet and approach new people my only real long term friend got a new friend group this summer that suddenly take priority these people also thinki ama fucking weirdo and want nothing to do with me i dont really blame themi got bullied a lot k12 i understand whyi amgenerally strange and aggravating to be around ive worked on it a lot so now people tolerate me for weeks instead of hours after high school i took a gap year in germany that was a mistake i was pretty lonely and just drank a lot and then i started blacking out turns out ptsd from being raped as a child can cause that and my family basically told me i was on my own and that they didnt want to deal with me coming back at the moment at the time the doctors were ruling out shit like brain tumors and thought i was having seizurescollege sucked i chose poorly and wasnt ready i did a yeari am still on leave i know i will never be able to afford to go backi am not sure that i want to up until thursday i didnt think i would have to because this summer after all of the bullshit the shit jobs the loneliness and everything else i managed to actually get the job i really wanted and then i went and somehow found a way to fuck it up actually no thats a lie i know exactly how i fucked it up by being myselfim not sure whats left at this point my entire life has been about making it to the next place because that wont suck right only it just seems to get more lonely and miserable no matter how hard i try i dont have dreams for the future anymore when people ask me where i seem myself in ten yearsi amcompletely lost because i cant imagine even being alive in ten years its not that i plan on being dead its that i dont see howi am going to make iti amjust tired i want to stop ive been pushing for what feels like my entire life now and i just want a break my earliest memories are of someone stomping on my fingers on the playground whilei am trying to draw something on a piece of paper i dont want this anymore
1,goodnight everyone i dont know honestlyi am trying my best and ive tried my best but ive been felling empty for so long i dont know whats happened to me but i cant go on like this gosh i dont mean to sound so dramatici amlost not because i dont know what to do but because despite doing everything i could nothing has changed 
1,i am just waiting out my inevitable end but i feel that i should vent and make myself feel betteri am not a very motivated person but my ambitions are great in proportion and i feel that any goal i put in front of myself whether its cleaning my room passing my college class not with an a just passing but everything i do that i dont set a goal for myself i do rather well and i feel like its some sort of shitty curse i gave to myself to forward my misery because god knows that no one else made me really unmotivated and lazy ive set goals up for myself and ive seen myself fail multiple times and it just hurts to see that happen and on top of thati ama very large dude and ive only gotten larger since i was done with football in high school and throughout my high school career no women would talk to me unless they actually wanted something from me like what were the answers for homework or using me as an into some football star and any advances ive made on people just crash and fail in a hindenberg of emotions and i usually just push everything down until i dont have to deal with it anymore which for most issues works most of the time ive also been in an accident where i killed a man walking home from dinner fault was on both sides i ran a red light because it was an angle to the light and i saw the green arrow for a left turn and as the angle came up i neglected to see the red light and drove past and hit him and on his side he was drunk high as a kite and literally half blind but none the less it was an incredible burden to put on a 17yearold kid who already feels pretty shitty about life oh also the prelude to all my emotional problems probably have root in the fact that my father was a raging alcoholic which to my siblings 3 all younger than me were thankfully spared from because there was quite a bit of space in years which meant that i was the most fit to make the drinks for my father and stay up past the other kids which put me in prime positions for his beatings until my mom who thankfully was never hurt decided that she had enough and took us away and finished her education and were pretty well off considering the fact on another note nice transition i know last year around this time i told my mother that i didnt want ive been having suicidal thoughts and it was only getting worse and worse i didnt tell my mother this but basically the only thing that was stopping me from killing myself was 1 my i didnt want my family to find my body thats a really shitting thing to do to the people that you care about along with the fact that my absence from the world permanently would really fuck up the entire family as i have close relationships with the majority of them at least them to me not so much me to them anymore ive slowly pushed most people away in annoyance to everything because people get really hard to tolerate sometimes also the other thing that prevented me from committing suicide was that i didnt have anything that i thought would end my life peacefully i had i shotgun and i love shooting it its a rather zhen thing just to shoot targets but that got taken away from me for obvious reasons after telling my mother which is difficult to explain that i wouldnt kill myself that way because i dont want to kill myself that way lol carrying on after i told my mom i agreed to be admitted to the hospital so i could get my noggin serviced unfortunately it was a rather full hospital that our insurance would cover so i had to sit in the psych er for a couple of days and that was just miserable i had to sit next to some legitimate loons in my passing who just got thrown in because the cops didnt want to deal with them and a lot and i mean a lot of girls who had a bad breakup essentially just being processed in and out as fast as they can the only person i could tolerate yes i know that all these people are suffering in their own way but i am not much of a people person to begin with so put me in with the rough patch of strawberries and it probably wont end up working out for my psyche was this recovering drug addict who got thrown in for being a loon in the bar part of town who was just struggling to get by in life and you could see the legitimate damage life could do to a man through his eyes i eventually got sick of waiting and really uncomfortable with having the cattle get brought in fed their pills and processed out so i decided to leave and leave i did and i didnt really have any serious issues because i was just glad to be out of there and didnt really think too much about it until nowi amstarting to have this feeling of worthlessness and selfpity and severe laziness creep back up in me and its a really shitty feeling and to be honest i probably would have killed myself if i wasnt so set in living in my moms attic with a highpowered pc and a vast catalog of games movies and tv shows to keep my mind chewing on something besides my shitty life whichi amprobably just too unmotivated to do anything about until its too late and i just get fed up with living a boring mundane and worthless life ps i also want to add that my best friend just left for boot camp a couple months ago and i mean he was like my serious best friend we got together like peanut butter and jelly but he got out of high school a year after me and enlisted because he thought itd be a good plan to get his life started and now thati amstarting to hear from him hes having talks about getting married and starting a family and moving on with his life within the next handful of years or so and thats somethingi am not willing to move to yet and if he moves on from life our ultimate selfinterests will just drive us apart in life until we maybe talk every now and then and losing my only nonmaterial release is just disheartening to me and i amlost because i now really have no friends and i am not the socialising type or really one to try to maintain friendships its just too much effort for me tldri amstuck between a rock and a hard place of being not being motivated enough to fix my life and not being in a shitty enough condition to kill myself and i amjust waiting out which part is going to break first the laziness or the will to live
